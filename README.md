# Group_Chat_In_CPP
As part of a submission task at Bar Ilan's Faculty of Engineering, we were required to build GroupChat (server and client). The communication protocol is TCP, version 2.2 and under Windows operating system. This project is not final and I will continue to develop it in the future. Also attached here is a PDF document in Hebrew explaining the code, if there is a demand - I will translate it into English.
